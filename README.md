QUESTION 1:
Sara has her psychology thesis submission tomorrow. She had vowed to her friends that she would digitise her ideas so that anyone can find their personality by giving their (relevant) informations. She has the brains but she lacks to code it. Help Sara to mock her friends by building this personality trait application.


Iteration 1: Be a Mentalist
You can frame up a certain set of questions. Sara’s friends would be keen to see their personality. They would try to be as genuine as possible. Sara has the limits and the informations to display. But she would need you to write the cascaded if statements to display the statements, since she claims herself to be poor in programming.

Iteration 2: Mimic Ptolemy
Every month has its own zodiac sign. Sara will do the math, She’d need your programming skills to make it a program. Along with, choose an appropriate partner for your friend. With Sara’s friends becoming serious with the previous iteration, she expects the same interest level for this iteration. But this is the place where Sara mocks her friends. She has very weird and funny partners for everyone. Again, you will be needing the help of selection statements in java to match her friends with their suitable parameters.

Iteration 3: Calendar man
How close is your birthday for a perfect surprise? Here you will have to find the exact age of her friends. This is not gonna do any magic to the application. But in future, maybe we can extend this application to set you a reminder or send a text on his/her birthday.

Well, well. I should be saying the end story as well. 

sample output is given below:
